For a Python app developed by a 6-person team nearing release, CI setup needs careful thought. Starting with linting - tools like Flake8 or Pylint would catch style issues and bugs early. For testing, pytest seems the go-to choice handling unit and integration tests, maybe with tox for environment management. Building could use setuptools or Poetry depending on how complex the packaging needs are.

CI options beyond Jenkins/GitHub Actions? Well there's GitLab CI if you're already using their platform, CircleCI for cloud-based workflows, and Travis CI though it's less dominant now. Some teams use AWS CodeBuild or Azure Pipelines too especially if they're in those ecosystems already.

Self-hosted vs cloud? Tough call. Self-hosted (like on-prem Jenkins) gives more control and might feel safer for sensitive data but needs serious maintenance effort. Cloud solutions (GitHub Actions, CircleCI) are quicker to start with and scale automatically - less headache about server updates.

To decide properly we'd need to know: What's our budget? How strict are security/compliance needs? Do we have spare server capacity? And honestly - does anyone on the team actually enjoy maintaining CI infrastructure? If not, cloud probably wins. Also how critical is uptime - cloud providers handle redundancy better than most self-setups.

No perfect answer really. For most teams starting out cloud CI makes sense with less overhead. But if you're in regulated industries or have special hardware needs self-hosted could be necessary. Main thing is getting those automated checks running before merge.
